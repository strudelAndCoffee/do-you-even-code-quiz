# Do You Even Code..? Quiz

A quick, timed quiz to test your general coding knowledge. This application was created in one week as a project for the University of Texas Code Boot Camp coursework. All code was developed by Stephen Trudell, with a mock-up, user story, and acceptance criteria provided as guidelines.

## User Story
